CompanyHouse API Analysis

Overview:
This Python project aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of trends in company creation and dissolution within the food services industry in Edinburgh from 2013 to 2023. The analysis focuses on subsectors such as licensed restaurants, unlicensed restaurants, take-away shops, and other food services. The primary objective is to ascertain the creation-to-dissolution ratio for each subsector, providing insights into the relative performance of businesses over the past decade. 

Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Utilize the CompanyHouse API to gather data on company creation and dissolution within the specified subsectors in Edinburgh.
2. Analysis: Calculate the creation-to-dissolution ratio for each subsector to assess its performance over the past decade.
3. Trend Identification: Identify standout years and periods of challenges for each subsector, offering insights into the economic landscape and external factors influencing the industry.

Key Findings:
- Creation-to-Dissolution Ratio: The analysis reveals fluctuations in the creation-to-dissolution ratio across subsectors over the past decade, highlighting periods of growth and challenges.
- Year-on-Year Trends: Standout years, such as 2017, indicate positive growth across all subsectors, while challenges were observed in subsequent years, possibly influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.

Insights:
- Licensed restaurants and take-away shops demonstrate relatively stable creation-to-dissolution ratios, suggesting a secure investment within the food services industry.
- Unlicensed restaurants and other food services exhibit higher volatility, indicating a riskier business landscape sensitive to external factors.

Future Scope:
- Explore additional factors influencing company creation and dissolution, such as economic indicators and consumer behaviour.
- Expand the analysis to include other regions in the UK for a broader understanding of industry trends nationwide.
